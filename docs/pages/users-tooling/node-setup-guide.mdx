# Node Setup Guide [Step by Step guide to set up up nodes to participate in Devnet]
This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up nodes to participate in the Surge Devnet. It covers the setup of a custom Bitcoin Signet node and a Surge node.

>Note: This guide is actively being developed and may change.

### Step 1: Install Docker

Install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Step 2: Setup Bitcoin Signet Node

Clone the Bitcoin Signet repository and navigate to the folder:

```sh copy
git clone https://github.com/surgebuild/bitcoin-signet && cd bitcoin_signet
````

### Step 3: Build & run the Signet container using Docker compose file:

```sh copy
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Verify Node

Verify if the node is running by checking the peer info:

Access the container:

```sh copy 
docker exec -it bitcoin-signet-bitcoind bash
```

Inside the container, check peer info:

```sh copy 
bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo
```

### Step 5: Setup Surge Node
